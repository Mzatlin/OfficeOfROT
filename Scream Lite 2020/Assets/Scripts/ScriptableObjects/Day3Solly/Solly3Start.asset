  - Not a very good look, is it?
  - I can...I can get you out, I-
  - "Don\u2019t worry about it, hon\u2026 I\u2019m on borrowed time, and AZT can
    keep off what\u2019s eating at me for so long."
  - What are you talking about?
  - "It doesn\u2019t matter. You know, I wish I had done something more with my time
    instead of working here to pay off my meds\u2026 In the little time I do have,
    I\u2026Agh, I want to say, but, but I don\u2019t want you thinking any less of
    me."
  - W-Why would I?
  - "You and Marsha made my days here. She helped me when no one else would, and
    you\u2026 well, like I said, I don\u2019t want you to think less of me."
  - "...oh. I\u2026 I would never, Sol. You\u2019re a good guy."
  - ... Thank you. That means a lot.
