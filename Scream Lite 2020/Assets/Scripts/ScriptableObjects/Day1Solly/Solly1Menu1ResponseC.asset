  sentences:
  - You always manage to get your work done perfectly and on time. Trade secrets?
  - "Don\u2019t play your day away on solitaire?"
  - What a cute joke! My partner tells me the same one every time I slack on the
    chores.
  - You give your wife a hard time, huh?
  - Like I said, trade secret.
  - Would if I had one.
  - "Too bad. Well I don\u2019t like sharing mine anyway, so it\u2019s probably for
    the best."
  - You offered first!
  - "\u201CI jumped the gun! Give me a break! It\u2019s been fun talking to you,
    but I have to get back to work. Have a good night!"
  - "Yeah, heh, \u2018work.\u2019 You too, Solly."
