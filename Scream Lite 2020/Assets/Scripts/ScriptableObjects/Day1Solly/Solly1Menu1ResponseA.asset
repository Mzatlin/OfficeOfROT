  sentences:
  - "That\u2019s awfully sweet of you! You doing anything fun tonight?"
  - Just hitting the bars. Nothing too special.
  - "Sounds fun! Tell me all about it when you get back. Oh\u2026 you\u2019re not
    going in your suit, are you?"
  - I mean, probably?
  - Not a good look for catching the eye. I can help you find something nicer if
    you want.
  - "I\u2019m not looking for anyone, Sol. Just need to get my mind off work."
  - You should try playing some solitaire. It distracts me from all my problems.
  - You mean like the reports you have to write?
  - "Exactly! I\u2019m close to winning this game. Go out and have a good time!"
