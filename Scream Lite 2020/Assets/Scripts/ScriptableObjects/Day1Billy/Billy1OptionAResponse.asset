  - "If it means I get to pretend to be better than you, then yes! Should\u2019ve
    applied a few months sooner."
  - "Maybe I should\u2019ve, then I could grill you for the eternity we\u2019ll be
    working here."
  - "Oh god, don\u2019t say that. You\u2019re gonna give me nightmares."
  - Well, yea, I got all my stuff done for Marsha. Wanna go to a bar later?
  - "Nah, can\u2019t. Speaking of Ms. Muillhauer, our beloved Supervisor threw some
    extra work on my plate. I won\u2019t be out of here \u2018till like, 3. As if
    my wife doesn\u2019t complain enough about my shifts."
  - "But you\u2019re still happy to do it, of course?"
  - Oh yea, I love working late into the night for the wicked witch of the west cubicle.
  - "Hey, just tap your ruby slippers a couple of times and you\u2019ll be home free."
  - Ha, screw you. Hope you choke on your beer.
  - If only I were so lucky.
  - "Haha, well, go on. Get out of here before she decides to keep you here too.
    I\u2019d go ahead and chat with some of the other guys, too. Seem real razzed
    lately. Don\u2019t let the mopping machine Frank catch you, though."
