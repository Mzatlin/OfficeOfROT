  sentences:
  - "Well, aren\u2019t we a dutiful little busy bee? You could slack off a little,
    would make me look more palatable for Ms. Millhauer."
  - "You know you can call her Marsha, right? She\u2019s not THAT uptight."
  - "Maybe not with you, you\u2019re on her good side. She strapped me down with
    so much work I had to skip dinner."
  - "You shouldn\u2019t do that. You\u2019re probably falling behind \u2018cause
    you\u2019re not eatin\u2019 right."
  - "Easy for you to say, you don\u2019t have a loving partner to squeeze five minutes
    of time into your busy schedule."
  - "Don\u2019t remind me\u2026"
  - "Hey, if you\u2019re lucky, maybe you\u2019ll meet someone at the bar. Go on
    and get out of here before Marsha decides she likes you a little less. Before
    you go, though, I\u2019d check in with the other guys. Seem razzed. Try to avoid
    Frank\u2019s line of sight if you can. Should be easy since all he does is mop."
