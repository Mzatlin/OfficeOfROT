  sentences:
  - God, I wish I could have a drink! I got no time or money to spare.
  - Good way to stay sober, though!
  - "Sobriety\u2019s over-rated. Besides, my wife had that covered before she\u2026
    well, lost her job."
  - "I\u2019m sorry-"
  - "Don\u2019t worry about it. Just means I have to work more. Nothing to it. Once
    its done maybe the wife can hit me instead of the bottle, and Marsha will give
    me a raise."
  - Want me to talk to her-
  - "No, don\u2019t. It\u2019s fine. Just\u2026 just go chat for a bit, ok? I need
    to focus."
