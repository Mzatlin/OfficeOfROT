  sentences:
  - "Oh wow, I didn\u2019t realize I was speaking to royalty! You got some money
    to spare for a poor peasant?"
  - Not much. You need some?
  - You got like 5 figures laying around?
  - ...no.
  - Some royalty. Well, if you have an old tv laying around we could use one. We
    just had to sell ours.
  - "My condolences\u2026"
  - None needed. The toddler can just watch the paint chip off the wall. Anyway,
    I gotta get back to this. Go chat with the others while I put numbers in places.
