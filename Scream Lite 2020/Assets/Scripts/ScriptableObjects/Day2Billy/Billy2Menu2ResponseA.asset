  sentences:
  - Perfectly! I slept a total of three hours! Had a long talk with the wife about
    my habits.
  - "That sounds\u2026 lovely."
  - You bet! Trying to explain to her how earning money is not easy and very, VERY
    time consuming, and our rundown house needs repairs.
  - What was it this time? The pipes? The floors?
  - "The roof! On the plus side, any time it rains, we have a nice waterfall installation
    in the little one\u2019s room."
  - Bet the kid loves that.
  - Oh, totally! Her cries were the other couple hours that took up my sleep time.
  - "You sure you don\u2019t want me to take any extra work from you?"
  - "Trust me, I don\u2019t need Marsha thinking of me any less than she does. Don\u2019t
    worry, you not helping helps a lot. Speaking of which, think you can mingle for
    a bit? I gotta focus on this earning\u2019s report."
