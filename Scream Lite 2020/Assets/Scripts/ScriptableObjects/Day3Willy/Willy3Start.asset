  sentences:
  - "I need a drink\u2026"
  - "Haven\u2019t you had enough of those?"
  - CHRIST!
  - "I know you\u2019ve been hitting the bottles. I know an alcoholic when I see
    one."
  - "I-I\u2019m not an-"
  - "You don\u2019t think I know someone who drinks to get through the day? Why do
    you think I drink so much water here? The hangovers are atrocious if you don\u2019t."
  - Jesus, Willy.
  - "It really weighs down on a guy. Dad gets to make money while I do all the work.
    Everyone here is afraid of me and refuses to talk to me. Except you. You\u2019re
    the only person in this place who pretends to even care."
  - "Willy\u2026"
  - "It\u2019s one thing for your dad to not care, it\u2019s another when the people
    who are in the same boat as you treat you like a pariah. I see you talking with
    the others and no matter how hard I try I could never have that. Everyone scattered
    to the winds the second I say \u2018hello.\u2019 So I waited here. Waited for
    anyone to talk to me. I was stupid to think otherwise. Like anybody would care
    about the rich boss\u2019s step-son."
  - His step-son?
  - "He never had any kids, married my mom, and now I\u2019m here. He won\u2019t
    even write me into his will. Isn\u2019t that awful? I run the place for him and
    he won\u2019t even consider me his actual flesh and blood. I\u2019m a joke. It\u2019s
    all I ever will be."
