  sentences:
  - "I\u2019m managing. Figuratively and literally."
  - Heh.
  - "Wasn\u2019t a joke."
  - Oh, sorry.
  - "Skip on the jokes, focus on getting your work done, and come back well rested,
    ok? You\u2019re a valuable team member and I don\u2019t want you running yourself
    ragged."
  - You mean like Billy?
  - "Yes, like Billy. If you want you can take some of his work. If he\u2019s going
    to complain about the extra work he asked for, he doesn\u2019t have to take it."
  - "Can\u2019t you forward his Christmas bonus, or something?"
  - "The last employee that was fired didn\u2019t even get a severance package. What
    do you think?"
  - Ah.
  - "If you\u2019re done complaining on Billy\u2019s behalf, I suggest you head out
    for the night."
  - "Yes ma\u2019am."
