  sentences:
  - "Mm\u2026 something like that."
  - "You really shouldn\u2019t be playing so much. It\u2019s a miracle Marsha hasn\u2019t
    fired you yet."
  - "Marsha and I have a\u2026 mutual understanding. I\u2019ll leave it at that."
  - I see.
  - "I just get tired more easily than most. So I take more breaks. So long as I
    get my work done on time, that\u2019s all that really matters."
  - "I don\u2019t know how you could when you\u2019re constantly playing with cards."
  - Like I said, mutual understanding.
  - Must be one hell of a mutual understanding, then.
