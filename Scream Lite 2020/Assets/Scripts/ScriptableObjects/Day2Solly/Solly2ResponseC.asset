  sentences:
  - Ha! Cute!
  - I mean, you seem to live here more than you do at your place.
  - "Now isn\u2019t that the truth."
  - "Don\u2019t you ever miss your bed?"
  - "You could say that! I moreso miss my bed back at my folks. But we\u2019re not
    on the best of terms."
  - "I\u2019m sorry to hear that\u2026"
  - "No worries! It\u2019s just how things played out. No use in getting upset over
    something that can\u2019t be controlled."
  - What do you mean?
  - "I\u2019d rather not get into it right now. I\u2019m close to winning this game
    of Solitaire. Au revoir!"
