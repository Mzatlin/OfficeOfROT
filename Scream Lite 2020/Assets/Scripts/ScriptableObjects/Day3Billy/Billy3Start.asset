  sentences:
  - JESUS CHRIST! BILLY!
  - What do you want?
  - You, you-
  - Yea, I know, I look like trash, whatever. I was working through the night, what
    do you want from me?
  - You were what?!
  - "The house is falling apart. She\u2019s had enough of me and wants to take the
    kid and move back in with her parents."
  - Oh god-
  - "It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just keep working. I\u2019ll keep working \u2018till
    I die, which if all works out, will be tonight."
  - Billy, what are you talking about?
  - "What does it sound like? I\u2019m done. Ive wasted my time and my life and no
    one cares. Not my wife, my kid, or that man eating freak in her special little
    cubicle. I don\u2019t care. Screw it."
  - Billy-
  - "Don\u2019t worry \u2018bout me. At least once the night\u2019s done I can buy
    a drink. A lot of them. Enough to last me a lifetime. By the way, thanks for
    chatting with me. Even if you made me look like a slacker in front of Marsha."
  - ...
  - "You act like I tied the noose already. Stop worrying about it. You\u2019ll forget
    me like the rest. I\u2019ve got work to do. Go bug someone else."
