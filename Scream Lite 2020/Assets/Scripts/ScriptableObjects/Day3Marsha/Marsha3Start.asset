  sentences:
  - You again.
  - "Oh my god\u2026"
  - What? Say it. Call me whatever terrible things you and your friends came up for
    me.
  - "What\u2019re you-"
  - "Doing this job is hard as hell. It\u2019s exhausting, tiring. I barely have
    time to sleep or do anything for me. But I managed. Somehow I managed. But you
    know what makes it unbearable? When you\u2019re constantly harassed and abused
    by your co-workers. Trying to find ways to protect Sol from losing their job,
    almost losing mine. All the while being told how horrible you are?"
  - ...
  - "Do you know how many complaints I\u2019ve filed for all the awful things that\u2019ve
    been said about me behind my back? Being groped by my boss and having my job
    used as leverage? Do you know how many times I was laughed out of that office?
    How humiliating that is?"
  - "I\u2026 I have no idea."
  - "What was one of the things they called me? A preying mantis? No no, a man eater?
    That\u2019s it\u2026 a man eater. If that\u2019s what they all want, then fine.
    I\u2019ll rip their tiny little heads right off. I\u2019m done being used and
    abused by you sick, disgusting people! "
  - Marsha...
  - "You\u2026 you\u2026 You were the only one who seemed to care. You and Sol were
    the only two here who treated me with any respect. I\u2026 Go. Just leave. I
    can\u2019t be  around you right now."
