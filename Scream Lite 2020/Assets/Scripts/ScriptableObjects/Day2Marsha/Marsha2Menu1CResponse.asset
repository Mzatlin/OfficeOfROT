  sentences:
  - "Thanks for the compliment. It\u2019s nicer than what I\u2019m used to hearing."
  - What do you usually hear?
  - "Oh you know, obscenities, how evil I am, all that. It\u2019s why I prefer living
    with cats over people."
  - I thought you were married?
  - "I was. But that didn\u2019t work out. Turns out he didn\u2019t like the idea
    of the wife putting the bread on the table."
  - "Oh\u2026"
