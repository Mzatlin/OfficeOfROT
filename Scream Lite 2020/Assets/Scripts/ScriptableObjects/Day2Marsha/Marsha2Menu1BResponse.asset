  sentences:
  - If you have something to say, then spit it out. Your co-workers are more than
    comfortable with doing that.
  - "They\u2019re not trying to insult you Marsha."
  - Strange. Feels that way.
  - You ever try talking to them?
  - "About what? Doing my job? Trying to do what\u2019s best and fair for the team?"
  - You mean like saddling Billy with extra work and letting Solly play Solitaire?
  - "Billy ASKED for the extra work, you know that. And Solly\u2026 Solly gets their
    work done. And if they can\u2019t, I find a way to get it done."
  - "That\u2019s not even remotely fair!"
  - "It is fair. It\u2019s about Equity, not Equality. I have my reasons for the
    way things are run, I would hope you of all people can trust me on that."
  - "I\u2026 sure. Fine."
  - "Life tends not to be kind, and neither does this business. If you don\u2019t
    like it, find somewhere else to work."
