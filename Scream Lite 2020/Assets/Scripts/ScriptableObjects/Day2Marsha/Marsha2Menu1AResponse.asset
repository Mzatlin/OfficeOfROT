  - "\u201CIs that the new insult at me from around the office?"
  - What do you mean?
  - "I just assumed people had been throwing around more comments at my expense.
    I must\u2019ve been mistaken."
  - "We\u2019re all adults, Marsha, we wouldn\u2019t-"
  - "I\u2019m not deaf, and I\u2019m definitely not stupid. I\u2019d say if anyone
    has complaints, take it to HR, but from my experience, they don\u2019t really
    listen."
  - What?
  - "Don\u2019t worry about it. I have work to finish up. I need to get home, forgot
    to feed the cat this morning."
